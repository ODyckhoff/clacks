Clacks
======

This is intended to be a system that converts characters into the 8-shutter clacks semaphore system, and back again.

I'm still debating whether to use ASCII conversions of the 8 bit value directly, with each "lamp" representing a bit, or to use the Braille system, which also consists of 8 "bits", but doesn't seem to conform to the ASCII system.

Is it cruel to create a light-shutter based semaphore system which requires vision and base it on a reading system designed for visually impaired people?
