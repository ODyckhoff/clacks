Clacks
======

This is intended to be a system that converts characters into the clacks semaphore system, and back again.

The literature suggests that the clacks system consisted of 8 shutters[1], although there are clacks interpretations that use 6 shutters, most notably the release of the Clacks board game. The board game Clacks is very limited in that it defines only the letters A-Z, a space, and the END character. I may base my clacks interpretations on this, adding to the symbol list to define extra characters, punctuation, numerals, and so on.

I'm still debating whether to use ASCII conversions of the 8 bit value directly, with each "lamp" representing a bit, or to use the Unified 8-dot Braille system, which also consists of 8 "bits", but doesn't seem to conform to the ASCII system.
For the 6-shutter version of Clacks, it may be easier to use the English Braille system which also uses 6 dots. However, the system used in the Clacks boardgame doesn't conform to 6-dot braille, unfortunately.[2]

Is it cruel to create a light-shutter based semaphore system which requires vision and base it on a reading system designed for visually impaired people?

[1] The Fifth Elephant, Page 24: "Lord Vetinari stood at his window watching the semaphore tower on the other side of the river. All eight of the big shutters facing him were blinking furiously - black, white, white, black, white..."
[2] As illustrated here: on the left is the letter "a" in English 6-dot Braille. On the right, is the letter "a" in Clacks board game semaphore, which interestingly corresponds to either the value "en", or "?" in English 6-dot Braille.
